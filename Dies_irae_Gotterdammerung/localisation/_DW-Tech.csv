submarine_coastal_systems;Coastal Design & Systems;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
submarine_coastal_systems_desc;This design is for small u-boats operating in coastal waters. Despite their limited range, they are harder to detect by ships and aircraft and due to their small size they are cheaper to build than the larger u-boats, and require less fuel. With diesel engines the type variants in this design are Type IIB, IIC, IID.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

submarine_mr_systems;Medium Range  Design & Systems;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
submarine_mr_systems_desc;Type VII U-boats were the most common type of German U-boat. The Type VII was based on earlier German submarine designs going back to the World War I Type UB III, designed through a Dutch dummy company set up by Germany in order to maintain and develop German submarine technology and to circumvent the limitations set by the Treaty of Versailles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

submarine_lr_systems;Long Range  Design & Systems;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
submarine_lr_systems_desc;Type IX U-boat was designed as a large ocean-going submarine for sustained operations far from the home support facilities. The extended range came at the cost of longer dive times and decreased maneuverability, which is why the smaller Type VII was produced in greater numbers and used for the bulk of operations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

GER_refueling_submarine_1;Type XIV Refueling U-Boat;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
refueling_submarine_desc;Refueling submarines, acting as refueling stations at sea, allow our submarines to reach more distant areas of operation, before having to return to port.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
schnorkel;Schnorkel-design;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
schnorkel_desc;Originally of a Dutch design, the schnorkel will allow our u-boots to sail using diesel engines, while submerged. This also allows the recharging of batteries under water, all in all helping us gain the element of surprise in convoy attacking, as well as in fighting enemy war ships. The downside is that the schnorkel makes a long trail in the water making the u-boot more likely to be spotted and attacked by enemy aircraft.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
submarine_hydrophone_equipment;Hydrophone Equipment;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
submarine_hydrophone_equipment_desc;Hydrophones consisted of two pairs of underwater microphones which listened to the sound of ships' propeller noises. By measuring the amount of time it took for sound to arrive at each of the microphones, the device could triangulate the bearing of the vessel from the U-boat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

submarine_sonar_equipment;Sonar Equipment;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
submarine_sonar_equipment_desc;Sonar Equipment consisted of two basic elements – a hydrophone and a sonar device. Once the hydrophone picked up the bearing of a surface vessel, the sonar would ping in that direction to determine range. Up to three short pulses may be needed, which when plotted together, enabled the operator to determine the target's speed, range and direction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

submarine_radar_equipment;Radar Equipment;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
submarine_radar_equipment_desc;U-boats radar systems can provide very useful navigation information in a variety of situations. When a vessel is within radar range of land, the navigator can take distances and angular bearings to charted objects and use these to establish arcs of position and lines of position on a chart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

submarine_radar_detector_equipment_desc;Since more and more vessels and planes use radar equipment, Radar Detection became very useful at spotting targets or threats at a safe distance. The arms race between the Axis and the Allies made the use of radar a key in the lif or the death of a U-Boat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

submarine_antisonar_coating;Anti-Sonar Rubber Coating;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
submarine_antisonar_coating_desc;To reduce the sonar echo of U-boats, the Germans experimented with synthetic rubber which coated the outer hull of the boats. Alberich consisted of synthetic rubber sheets of about 4mm in thickness which had sound absorbing properties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
submarine_antisonar_coating_1;Alberich;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
submarine_antiradar_coating;Anti-Radar Schnorkel Coating;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
submarine_antiradar_coating_desc;Anti-Radar Schnorkel Coating was a radar absorbing material used to coat snorkel heads to shield them from allied radar. It consisted of a compound of synthetic rubber and iron oxide and was claimed to have 90 percent effectiveness in reducing radar signature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
submarine_antiradar_coating_1;Tarnmatte;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
submarine_advanced_engines;Advanced Engines;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
submarine_advanced_engines_desc;The key improvement in a submarine engine is to increase its battery capacity. This gives these boats enormous underwater range, and dramatically reduced the time spent near the surface. That way they can operate entirely submerged, rather than as surface ships that could submerge as a temporary means to escape detection or launch an attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

submarine_radar_decoys_desc;As allied radar technology advanced, the Germans deployed radar decoys to fool the allies into thinking that a U-boat was present. Radar decoys were deployed either by balloons or floating buoys and were designed to reflect radar waves which could look like a surfaced U-boat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

fall_weiss_operation;Fall Weiß;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fall_weiss_operation_desc;Fall Weiss was the Nazi strategic plan for the invasion of Poland. The German military High Command finalized its operational orders on 15 June 1939 and the invasion commenced on 1 September, precipitating World War II. Fall Weiss was developed primarily by Günther Blumentritt and Erich von Manstein while the two were serving as staff officers under General Gerd von Rundstedt with Army Group South in Silesia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
weserubung_operation;Operation Weserübung;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
weserubung_operation_desc;Operation Weserübung was the code name for Nazi Germany's assault on Denmark and Norway in the early morning of 9 April 1940.\nThe initial invasion force was transported to Norway in several groups by capital ships and escorts of the Kriegsmarine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fall_gelb_operation;Fall Gelb;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fall_gelb_operation_desc;German invasion of France and the Low Countries, executed from 10 May 1940. The battle consisted of two main operations. In the first, Fall Gelb, German armoured units pushed through the Ardennes, to cut off and surround the Allied units that had advanced into Belgium. In the second operation, Fall Rot, executed from 5 June, German forces outflanked the Maginot Line to attack the larger territory of France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tannenbaum_operation;Operation Tannenbaum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tannenbaum_operation_desc;Germany started planning the invasion of Switzerland on 25 June 1940, the day France surrendered. At this point the German Army in France consisted of three army groups with 2 million soldiers in 102 divisions. Switzerland and Liechtenstein were completely surrounded by Occupied France and the Axis Powers, and so Guisan issued Operationsbefehl Nr. 10, a complete overhaul of existing Swiss defensive plans. Hitler never gave the go-ahead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sealion_operation;Operation Seelöwe;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sealion_operation_desc;Operation Sea Lion was Germany's plan to invade the United Kingdom. With the prospect of the Channel ports falling under Kriegsmarine control and attempting to anticipate the obvious next step that might entail, Grand Admiral Erich Raeder instructed his Operations officer to draw up a document examining 'the possibility of troop landings in England should the future progress of the war make the problem arise.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
afrika_operation;Afrika Korps;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
afrika_operation_desc;The Deutsches Afrikakorps was the German expeditionary force in Libya and Tunisia during the North African Campaign.\n§WThis technology gives access to several Afrika Korps units (Infantry, Motorized, Mechanized and Armor brigades) designed to fight in North Africa. You can equip existing units with Afrika Korps equipment with the upgrade function.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
barbarossa_operation;Operation Barbarossa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
barbarossa_operation_desc;Operation Barbarossa was the code name for Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union that began on 22 June 1941. Over 4.5 million troops of the Axis powers invaded the USSR along a 2,900km front. Planning for Operation Barbarossa started on 18 December 1940, the secret preparations and the military operation itself lasted almost a year, from spring to winter 1941.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
winter_clothes;Winter Clothes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
winter_clothes_desc;§RThis technology cancels the §GGeneral Winter§R Strategic Effect. §BThe Russian Winter is a common justification for military failures of invaders in Russia. During Barbarossa, the Wehrmacht lacked necessary supplies, such as winter uniforms, due to the many delays in the German army's movements. Hitler was so confident of a quick victory that he did not prepare for even the possibility of winter warfare in Russia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
russian_railways;Russian Railways refit;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
russian_railways_desc;§RThis technology cancels the §GRussian Railways§R Strategic Effect. §BOne of the major logistical problems during Barbarossa was the different railway gauge the Russians had. German trains simply can't use the wide Russian rails. This means we need to refit either the railways or the trains for better transportation of supplies to the front.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
